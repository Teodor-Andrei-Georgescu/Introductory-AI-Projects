# Assignment 1: Searching and Constraint Satisfaction Problems

This directory contains all the files related to **Assignment 1** of the course CSC421 Fall 2024. The assignment focuses on search algorithms and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), foundational techniques in Artificial Intelligence.

## Overview
The assignment covers the following questions:

### Question 1: Search (Basic) - Add Connection to Romania Map
Modify the Romania map problem to add a new connection and validate the updated search behavior. The implementation involves basic graph traversal techniques.

### Question 2: Search (Basic) - Return Frontier Evolution
Implement a search algorithm that keeps track of and returns the evolution of the search frontier.

### Question 3: Search (Expected) - RandomSearch
Develop and analyze a random search algorithm to navigate simple problems like grid-based paths.

### Question 4: Search (Expected) - Change Grid Problem to 4 Directions and Modulo Movement
Adjust the grid problem to restrict movement to four directions and implement modulo constraints on transitions.

### Question 5: Search (Expected) - Landgrid Problem
Solve a problem involving a land grid with specific constraints using a suitable search strategy.

### Question 6: Search (Expected) - Manhattan Distance
Implement and evaluate the Manhattan distance heuristic in a pathfinding problem.

### Question 7 (Not Completed): Search (Advanced) - Experimental Comparison/New Heuristic or Visualization
Experiment with advanced search heuristics or create visualizations to analyze search algorithms' performance.

### Question 8: CSP (Basic) - Basic CSP for Map Coloring
Solve a simple map-coloring CSP problem using unitary constraints.

### Question 9: CSP (Expected) - Type Inference Toy Example
Formulate a type inference problem as a CSP and solve it using constraint-solving techniques.

### Question 10: CSP (Advanced) - CSP as a Search Problem
Extend the type inference example or represent it as a search problem for advanced analysis.
