The notebook is self-contained and other than importing a few common packages you don't need to access any additional code. \n",

    "You are welcome (and actually it can be educational) to look at the code at the aima-code repository as well as other code resources you can find on the web or ask ChatGPT. However, make sure you understand any code that you incoporate and submit. A random subset of students will be examined in person and will be asked questions about the code submitted. Failure to understand submitted code will result in a 0 grade for the entire assignment. Although similar assignments have been given in previous offerings of the course small changes have been made. Any students submitting code that solves previous versions of the assignment will also be examined in person. \n",

    "Create a new class of search problems called **GridProblemMod** \n",
    "by modifying and renaming the **GridProblem** class below appropriately. The two modifications that you will need to implement in this question are to restrict the directions the agent can move to so that no diagonal movement is allowed i.e only up/right/down/left movement using that order. Note: the order is important for the auto-grading. Unlike the original **GridProblem**, in this case the grid will be finite. Add a parameter to the __init__ method called size that determines the size $N$ of the land grid which is a $N$ by $N$ square. The movement should implement wrap-around using modulo arithmetic i.e if the agent in a grid of size $10$ is in square $(0,5)$ and the action $(-1,5)$ is applied then the agent should move to square $(10,5)$. Another way to think of it is that when the agent reaches the boundary of the land grid they **jump** to the other side. The path shown below demonstrates this wrap-around behavior. \n"
