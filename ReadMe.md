# Introductory AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for an introductory artificial intelligence (AI) course. Each folder corresponds to a specific assignment that explores a key area of AI. Inside each folder, you'll find detailed README files with further explanations and instructions for that particular assignment. Below is an overview of what each assignment covers:

## Assignment 1: Searching and Constraint Satisfaction Problems
This assignment delves into foundational AI techniques for problem-solving:
- Implementing search algorithms (e.g., random search, best-first search, etc.
- Adding and testing heuristics like Manhattan distance.
- Solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) such as map coloring and type inference.

## Assignment 2: Propositional and First-Order Logic
This assignment focuses on logical reasoning:
- Evaluating prefix logical expressions using custom parsers.
- Implementing Boolean logic circuits and knowledge bases in Prolog.

## Assignment 3: Probabilistic Reasoning and Hidden Markov Models
This assignment explores probabilistic reasoning and models:
- Using Bayesian networks for inference.
- Investigating non-transitive dice with random variables.
- Modeling biological data (e.g., DNA sequences) using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

## Assignment 4: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Classification
This assignment introduces machine learning techniques:
- Implementing Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers on datasets.
- Training Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers for digit recognition.
- Using PyTorch to train neural networks and exploring the effects of noise on image classification.

Each folder contains:
- **Code files** for implementation.
- **Dataset files** (where applicable) to test the code.
- **README** with detailed instructions, requirements, and expected outcomes.
